Syntax:
[X,Y,F,N_F,IT,T_ELAP,FLAG] = DF_SIMPLEX(OBJ,A,Y0)
[X,Y,F,N_F,IT,T_ELAP,FLAG] = DF_SIMPLEX(OBJ,A,Y0,OPTS)

Note that the DF-SIMPLEX function is defined with an additional output
argument in last position. This output is needed to pass the polling
samples collected by DF-SIMPLEX to ORD, but it can be ignored if DF-SIMPLEX
is called as standalone. 

Input arguments:
- OBJ (required) is the objective function, passed as a function handle;
- A (required) is the n-by-m matrix of atoms, where each column is an
  n-dimensional atom;
- Y0 (required) is the vector of coefficients that express the starting
                points as a convex combination of the atoms
                (so, the coefficients must be non-negative and sum to 1,
                but such a check is not included in the code, in order to
                avoid unwanted breaks due to numerical issues);
- OPTS (optional) is a structure with the following algorithm parameters:
    EPS_OPT is the stopping tolerance for the stationarity condition, i.e.,
            the threshold on the stepsizes on the normalized directions
            (default value = 1e-4)
    MAX_N_F is the maximum number of objective function evaluations
            (default value = 100*(n+1))
    MAX_IT is the maximum number of iterations
            (default value = Inf, i.e., it is not used)
    F_STOP is a target objective value to stop the algorithm
           (devalut value = -Inf, i.e., it is not used)
    MAX_TIME is the maximum cpu time in seconds, measured at the end of
             every outer iteration
             (devalut value = Inf, i.e., it is not used)
    F0 is the objective value at the starting point
       (devalut value =  none, i.e., it will be computed)
    ALPHA_INI is the initial value of the stepsizes
              (default value = max(5e-1,eps_opt) scaled by the maximum norm
              of the directions),
    VERBOSITY is a logical to print or not iterations details
              (default value = true)

Output arguments:
- X is the final solution found by the algorithm;
- Y is the vector of coefficients to express X as a convex combination of
  atoms (i.e., x = A*y);
- F is the objective value at X;
- N_F is the number of objective function evaluations;
- IT is the number of iterations;
- T_ELAP is the cpu time in seconds;
- FLAG is an integer describing the exit condition:
    0 the stationarity condition is satisfied with the desired tolerance,
    1 if the maximum number of function evalations is reached,
    2 if the maximum number of iterations is reached,
    3 if the target objective value is obtained,
    4 if the maximum cpu time is exceeded.
