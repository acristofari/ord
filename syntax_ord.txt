Syntax:
[X,Y,F,N_F,IT,T_ELAP,FLAG] = ORD(OBJ,A,I0)
[X,Y,F,N_F,IT,T_ELAP,FLAG] = ORD(OBJ,A,I0,OPTS)

Input arguments:
- OBJ (required) is the objective function, passed as a function handle;
- A (required) is the n-by-m matrix of atoms, where each column is an
  n-dimensional atom;
- I0 (required) is the index of the atom (i.e., of the column of A) used as
  starting point;
- OPTS (optional) is a structure with the following algorithm parameters:
    EPS_OPT is the stopping tolerance for the stationarity condition, i.e.,
            the threshold on the stepsizes scaled by the maximum norm of
            the direction
            (default value = 1e-4)
    MAX_N_F is the maximum number of objective function evaluations
            (default value = 100*(n+1))
    MAX_IT is the maximum number of iterations
            (default value = Inf, i.e., it is not used)
    F_STOP is a target objective value to stop the algorithm
            (devalut value = -Inf, i.e., it is not used)
    MAX_TIME is the maximum cpu time in seconds, measured at the end of
             every iteration
            (devalut value = Inf, i.e., it is not used)
    N_INITIAL_ATOMS is the number of atoms used in the first iteration
            (default value = m, i.e., all atoms),
    SET_INITIAL_ATOMS is a vector with the indices of the atoms to use in
                      the first iteration, if it is empty the atoms are
                      chosen randomly
                      (default value = empty vector)
    USE_MODEL can be a logical value indicating whether or not the simplex
              gradient must be used, or can be a numerical value indicating
              the maximum dimension of the reduced problem for which the
              simplex gradient must be used
              (default value = true)
    VERBOSITY is a logical to print or not iterations details
              (default value = true)

Output arguments:
- X is the final solution found by the algorithm;
- Y is the vector of coefficients to express X as a convex combination of
  atoms (i.e., x = A*y);
- F is the objective value at X;
- N_F is the number of objective function evaluations;
- IT is the number of iterations;
- T_ELAP is the cpu time in seconds;
- FLAG is an integer describing the exit condition:
    0 the stationarity condition is satisfied with the desired tolerance,
    1 if the maximum number of function evalations is reached,
    2 if the maximum number of iterations is reached,
    3 if the target objective value is obtained,
    4 if the maximum cpu time is exceeded.
